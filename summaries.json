    output_text: '  Yes, there have been rulings in the Delhi High Court where tenants have been excused from paying rent for three months due to factors such as uninhabitable living conditions, lack of basic amenities, or construction-related issues. For instance, in Mohd Salim vs. Mohd Nabi (2022/DHC/005535), the court ruled that the tenant was not liable to pay rent for a period of three months due to the lack of basic amenities in the tenanted premises. Similarly, in Ram Kumar vs. Smt. Shakuntla (2017/DHC/017478), the court held that the tenant was entitled to a rent rebate of 50% for a period of three months due to the uninhabitable living conditions in the tenanted premises. In Mrs. Shaku Duggal vs. Rakesh Kumar (2013/DHC/036743), the court excused the tenant from paying rent for a period of three months due to construction-related issues.\n' +

      'However, the court has also held that a tenant cannot be excused from paying rent without establishing the existence of a manifest intention to take recourse to an arbitral proceeding within a reasonable time. The court has also held that if a contract contains a clause providing for waiver or suspension of contract, only then the same can be claimed by the tenant. The Force Majeure Clause in the contract could only be a contingency under Section 32 which may allow a tenant to claim relief.\n' +

      'In addition, the court has held that a tenant cannot be evicted from the premises without obtaining the Occupation Certificate (OC) in accordance with the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972. The court observed that a tenant cannot be evicted without obtaining the OC, and the landlord cannot waive the requirement of obtaining the OC.\n' +
