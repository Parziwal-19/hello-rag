         HUF and its properties came into existence whether before
         1956 or after 1956. It is no longer enough to simply state in
         the plaint after passing of the <a href="/doc/685111/" id="a_105">Hindu Succession Act</a> 1956, that
         there is a joint Hindu family or an HUF and a person is a
         coparcener in such an HUF/joint Hindu family for such
         person to claim rights in the properties as a coparcener unless
         the entire factual details of the cause of action of an HUF and
         each property as an HUF is pleaded.&quot;

<blockquote id="blockquote_40">         &quot;9. The plea of Mr. Rustagi that the actual HUF, which was
         formed at the birth of the appellant on November 05, 1978 and
         then on the birth of respondent No. 1, who became a Member by
         birth in 1982 has to be read in conjunction with other
         averments in the plaint that the HUF was instituted with funds
         available in the hands of respondent No. 2, who duly

         acknowledged the same in various statutory records, which
         records are stated to be in the exclusive custody of respondent
         No. 2. In other words, the funds were invested only to
         purchase the properties, which have been in the joint names of
         all the co-parceners with exception of name of respondent No.
         3, is without any merit, for the simple reason, what was
         required to be pleaded by the appellant was that the properties
         were inherited before the year 1956 or the HUF being created
         after the year 1956 by throwing the properties into common
         hotchpotch, which plea admittedly has not been taken. In fact,
         this aspect had weighed with the learned Single Judge to
         conclude that the claim as HUF properties (under first and
         second category), was unsustainable. We agree with the said
         conclusion arrived at by the learned Single Judge.&quot;
</blockquote><p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_51">27.   The position which emerges from a reading of the aforesaid
judgments is that specific pleadings have to be made in the plaint with
regard to existence and/or creation of an HUF, i.e., the date on which the
HUF was created, whether it was created after 1956, who were and are its
coparceners and karta and in the event the HUF was created after 1956,
when was the property claimed to be an HUF property, put in the common
hotchpotch.

of the present case. There is no averment in the plaint that late Shri Ram
Gopal, father of the plaintiff inherited the property from his paternal
ancestors prior to 1956 and hence, the suit land cannot be a HUF property in
his hands. It has also not been pleaded that the HUF was created after 1956
by late Shri Ram Gopal by throwing the suit land into a common
hotchpotch. The plaintiff has simply referred to the suit land as an ancestral
property in the plaint without giving any basis for the same. While deciding

considered is not whether the plaintiff has a cause of action to file the suit,
but as to whether the plaint, read as a whole, has disclosed a cause of action.
In the present case, there is no cause of action which is found to exist in the
plaint with respect to existence of an HUF and/or coparcenary property. The
plaintiff has failed to plead a case of existence of an HUF and/or
coparcenary property and therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to benefit of
the judgment passed in <a href="/doc/67965481/" id="a_110">Vineeta Sharma</a> (supra).</span>
</p><p data-structure="Conclusion" id="p_53">29.   In view of the discussion above, no cause of action has been
established by the plaintiff in her favour which ought to be considered in
