                             1336/94 filed by J.C. Khosla against the appellant under <a href="/doc/91605396/" id="a_12">Section 92</a> of the

                             jurisdictional limits of the Trial Court. In the said suit J.C. Khosla moved
                             an application under <a href="/doc/161831507/" id="a_13">Order 39 Rule 2A of the CPC</a> alleging violation of

                             advertised the sale of the Institute. However, the Coordinate Bench of this
                             Court has made the observation, after considering all the issues raised by
                             J.C. Khosla pertaining to the alleged transfer of society assets to the
                             Maharishi Ayurvedic Products and also the circumstances such as

                             held that there was no transfer of assets of the appellant society and
                             merely induction of new members in the society and in the governing
                             body of the society did not tantamount to transfer of assets of the society.
                             It is therefore submitted that the issue of transfer of the premises in
                             question no longer remains res integra and had already been decided by
                             the Coordinate Bench of this Court. Thus, the Trial Court erred in

</p><p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_31">                                           25. After considering the rival submissions, I am of
                                           the considered opinion that arguments of counsel f 0t
                                           the defendants are more well founded. So long as a
                                           provision exists on the Statute it must be observed
                                           instead of being ignored. The difficulty in complying
                                           with the provision is no answer and no ground for
                                           non compliance. When the Legislature has purposely
                                           retained the provisions in its wisdom, the Court
                                           cannot dispense with the same. The act of the
                                           defendant in cancellation of lease cannot be said to
                                           be beyond the purview of the Act. It may be legal or
                                           illegal but it is within the power of the lessor to do
                                           so. Power to take a decision includes power to take
                                           wrong decision also. The plaintiff cannot take upon
                                           itself the task of deciding whether the action of the
                                           defendant is legal or not.

<p data-structure="Conclusion" id="p_32">                                           26. In view of the above discussion, the issue is
                                           decided against the plaintiff and in favour of the

<p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_33">                             25.   The Trial Court while making the observations in favour of the
                             respondents, defendants therein, observed that mere difficulty to comply
                             with a provision would not permit the appellant to entirely dispense with
                             the service of the notice. It further noted that due to non-service of the
                             notice the appellant assumed that the decision of the respondent of
                             cancellation of the Lease Deed was erroneous and hence, bypassing the
                             provision, he approached the Trial Court without serving the notice.

                                           application for grant of leave. From this it could also
                                           be easily presumed that the Court had impliedly
                                           granted the leave to institute the suit or that the

                                           Development Act, 1957 is the same as that
                                           of <a href="/doc/55198661/" id="a_50">Section 80</a> of CPC; which is to bring the plaintiff&#x27;s
                                           claim to the notice of the Authority so that it may
                                           make up its mind whether to concede the claim or to
                                           contest it. In that matter, the provisions of
                                           both <a href="/doc/55198661/" id="a_51">Sections 80</a> CPC as well as <a href="/doc/128121466/" id="a_52">Section 53-B</a> of the

                                           consideration. The plaintiffs contended that since no
                                           objection had been taken to the non-issuance of the
                                           requisite notice under <a href="/doc/55198661/" id="a_53">Section 80</a> CPC by the
                                           defendants, and since the suit had proceeded and an
                                           ad interim injunction had also been granted,
                                           therefore, the requirement of notice under <a href="/doc/55198661/" id="a_54">Section 80</a>
                                           CPC be deemed to be waived. It was also prayed that
                                           under the circumstances, leave may be granted
                                           under <a href="/doc/131293703/" id="a_55">Section 80(2)</a> of the CPC to institute the suit
                                           without service of requisite notice. The Court held
                                           that the object of a notice under Section 80 is to
                                           afford the government an opportunity to examine the
                                           nature of the claim and if it thinks fit to settle the
                                           claim and to avoid unnecessary litigation. On the
                                           facts, the court held that the plaintiffs&#x27; application
                                           under <a href="/doc/131293703/" id="a_56">Section 80(2)</a> CPC praying for leave to
                                           institute          the          suit            without
                                           issuing notice under <a href="/doc/55198661/" id="a_57">Section 80</a> CPC ought to have
                                           been disposed of by the trial court. At the same time,
                                           the court also held that in view of the fact that the
                                           suit had already been registered, and an ex-parte
                                           interim order was passed in the suit, it can be
                                           presumed that the court had impliedly granted leave
                                           to       institute     that     suit       or      that
                                           the notice stood waived on      the      facts      and
                                           circumstances of the case. As regards, the non-

                                           true that Section 53-B of the Delhi Development Act
                                           does not have any provision analogous
                                           to <a href="/doc/131293703/" id="a_58">Section 80(2)</a> of CPC, however, since the Court

                                           through, notice under Section 53-B       should       be
                                           deemed to be waived for the reason that the purpose
                                           of notice both under Section 53-B of the Delhi
                                           Development Act as well as under <a href="/doc/55198661/" id="a_59">Section 80</a> of CPC
                                           is the same, which is, to bring the claim to
                                           the notice of the Authority concerned so that it may
                                           either contest it or concede the same. It felt that once

                                           respondent defendant had duly filed its written
                                           statement in the suit without raising any objection to

                                           of the Delhi Development Act. Furthermore, this
                                           written statement only came to be filed after
                                           23rd March, 1992 when the interim orders staying
                                           dispossession were made absolute. Thereafter, the
                                           respondent moved an application under <a href="/doc/161831507/" id="a_65">Order 7 Rule

                                           that since no such plea had been raised by the

                             the Trial Court, amongst the same parties an interim order was also
                             passed by the Coordinate Bench of this Court. Therefore, it is also not the

                             admittedly a DDA plot leased to the appellant. The prior knowledge of

                             1995 was found to be unsatisfactory. A bare reading of Sub-<a href="/doc/7353433/" id="a_75">section 3</a> of
                             the <a href="/doc/128121466/" id="a_76">Section 53B</a> of the DD Act, reveals that the legislature, while drafting
                             the Act, intended to accommodate the persons seeking injunction and
                             immediate relief against the act purported to be done by the DDA or any
                             of its members. If the intention of the legislature is not given effect, the
                             operation of the Act itself and the provisions thereunder may fall flat on
                             its face in fulfilling the objective of Act. Similarly, in the case of the
                             appellant, it was seeking injunction against the respondent from eviction
                             from the subject land and hence, the relief sought was urgent and
                             immediate. A service of notice of two months would have changed the
                             entire course of the proceedings between the parties and would have even
                             defeated the purpose of the suit. Therefore, this Court finds force in the
                             argument advanced on behalf of the appellant.

                             the appellant had parted with the title and ownership of the appellant
                             Institute by transferring the same in the name of a third party and had
                             thereby violated the terms of the Lease Deed. On the other hand, the
                             appellant had submitted that the respondent had failed to establish before
                             the Trial Court that there was a transfer of ownership to the third party
                             and despite the same the Trial Court had recorded a finding against the
                             appellant and in favour of the respondent.

                                           Agreement to Sell, GPA, Will which are indirect
                                           methods of transferring the property. The superior
                                           lessor such as DDA is not a party to the transaction
                                           and cannot be expected to possess the documents of
                                           transfer of title. The same has to be gathered from
                                           the facts and circumstances. Viewed from that angle
                                           the plaint read as a whole gives sufficient impression
                                           that the plaintiff has virtually admitted that it
                                           transferred the premises. The case set up by the
                                           plaintiff that it was running in financial crises was
                                           not able to repay the loan taken from financial
                                           institution, decided to set up an Ayurvedic set up of
                                           medicines all show that the plaintiff practically
                                           transferred the property. The advertisement for sale
                                           published in newspaper is another indication of the
                                           said transfer. Affidavit of Sh. Subhash Gupta,
                                           property agent is the other circumstance to show the
                                           transfer. Reply of Income Tax Department that there
                                           was transaction of sale of the property for
                                           consideration of Rs.4.5 Crores as alleged by the
                                           brokers and other circumstantial evidence reflected
                                           in document Ex.DW1/6 is yet another act in the
                                           series to show the transfer. The plea of the plaintiff
                                           that there could be post facto permission for transfer
                                           of payment on 50% unearned increase is yet another
                                           half hearted admission on the part of plaintiff to
                                           show that property has been transferred. Last but not
                                           the least is the step taken by the plaintiff to
                                           compound the matter with the defendant after filing
                                           of the suit. Now once that request for compounding
                                           has been declined by the defendant, plaintiff cannot
                                           take a round tum and say that there was no transfer.

                                           property has been transferred to him. That is how the
                                           signboard of that third person was found at the spot.
                                           The plaintiff did not dare to deny the existence of that
                                           third person or the inspection or the displaying of
                                           signboard of that third person. He has simply tried to
                                           make out that it was a case of transfer of
                                           management. For that it has not brought on record
                                           the details of management of the Maharashi
                                           Ayuvedic Arogyashala. If said society is an
                                           independent society registered separately, it has its
                                           own identity. Simply because the management of the
                                           two is somewhat common, it does not mean that the
                                           two societies are one and same.

                             Company, [1893] 1 QB 256 and Partridge vs. Crittenden, [1968] 2 All
                             ER 421, and has also been discussed widely in the law of contract, is that
                             an advertisement, is an invitation to offer and not implied sale. In the
                             instant case, the advertisement which has been relied upon by the
                             respondent before the Trial Court could not have been said to be a proof
                             of sale or transfer of the appellant Institute. This Court does not agree
                             with the findings of the Trial Court to this respect and finds that mere
                             advertisement did not conclusively prove that the transfer was actually
                             completed in favour of a third party.
</p>
<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_60">                             43.   Another consideration before the Trial Court was whether the
                             appellant had transferred the property in name of the third party for a
                             consideration of ₹4.5 cr. It has been contented by the appellant, that the
                             appellant institute was not able to sustain itself and its complete operation
                             thereof due to financial crunch and constraints. Thereafter, by inducting
                             concerned persons, Ajay Prakash and Anand Prakash, the new wing of
                             Ayurveda medicines and treatment was introduced to the appellant
                             institute to not only facilitate the financial constraints faced by the
                             institute but also to set up a new field of medicine in the appellant
                             hospital so as to provide a better infrastructure and medical facilities to
                             the public at large. On this aspect, an observation which is imperative to
                             be seen is that the Trial Court itself noted that there is no conveyance
                             deed or even any other document, including document of agreement to
                             sale, title or ownership deeds, to show that the appellant institute had
                             been transferred in the name of the third party. The entire observations of

                             contentions of the respondents were not substantiated by any title or
                             ownership document to conclusive establish that there was a transfer of
                             the suit property by the appellant to the third party.
</p>
<p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_61">                             44.   Another contention which has been raised by the respondent before
                             this Court, is that the management was internally altered to accommodate
                             the transfer of institute when the third party, i.e., Maharishi Ayurved
                             Mandir was given 2/3rd share in the management. However, the Trial
                             Court has not made any observation to this contention raised by the
                             respondent before this Court. Hence, a fresh plea before this Court which
                             has not been raised before the Trial Court and has not been adjudicated
                             upon by the said Court, cannot be looked into by this Court at this stage.

<p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_62">                             45.   Keeping in view, the aforesaid consideration, this Court does not

                             appellant Institute had been transferred in the favour of the third party.
                             The Trial Court while deciding the issue while coming to the conclusion
                             that the property and management of the appellant Institute was
                             transferred to a third party, passed certain vague observations, which are
                             reproduced hereunder, and were not substantiated by any conclusive
                             evidence, by way of any document of title or conveyance deed etc. to
                             show that the transfer was made in the favour of a third party:

                             while passing the impugned order on the following counts:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">                                   Firstly, the Trial Court failed to appreciate the intention of the
                                   legislature and the spirit of the provision under <a href="/doc/128121466/" id="a_80">Section 53B</a> of the
                                   DD Act as well as the interpretation attached to the provision by
                                   the various benches of this Court, according to which once the suit
                                   had been instituted, reached the Court of law, argued on merits
                                   comprehensively for over a decade then the notice under <a href="/doc/128121466/" id="a_81">Section
                                   53B</a> of the DD Act is rendered insignificant and irrelevant. The
                                   dismissal of the suit on this ground was unfounded and erroneous.

<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_74">                             52.   It is travesty of justice that an institution contributing for noble
                             cause being that of running a charitable hospital on a public land and
                             providing for sound research and treatment facilities has been made to
                             suffer the rigors of cancellation of the Lease Deed and vacation of the
                             property. Law that should be an instrument for ensuring welfare is being
                             reduced to a tool of atrocity in the instant case. Being a constitutional
                             court and the conscience-keeper of the democracy, this Court cannot lend
                             a blind eye when the ends of justice are being bulldozed in broad
                             daylight. The institution is imparting the state‟s welfare functions and
                             should otherwise be done by the instrumentalities of state. Even in such a
                             case, undue harassment being caused to the appellant will lead to an
                             anathema of the rule of law.
