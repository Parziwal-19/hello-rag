                          clear! However, in the case of advertisements which are alleged to be
                          surrogate, the lines are blurred.

<p data-structure="Facts" id="p_5">                          4.     As per the impugned order passed by the Respondent, the Petitioner
                          ran an advertisement of &quot;All Seasons&quot; Club Soda which was a surrogate
                          advertisement for &quot;All Seasons&quot; Whisky, sold in a similar bottle and layout.
                          The telecast of the advertisement took place during the LIVE coverage of
                          the Independence Day event. The footage which was shown to the Court
                          shows that in the said live telecast, an &#x27;L&#x27; shaped advertisement was
                          broadcast on the `Aaj Tak&#x27; TV channel, which, according to the Petitioner,
                          relates to the &quot;All Seasons&quot; Club soda product. The Ministry of Information
                          and Broadcasting (hereinafter, &#x27;I&amp;B Ministry&#x27;), however, found the same
                          objectionable in terms of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1776076/" id="a_2">Cable Television Networks
                          (Regulation) Act, 1995</a> and issued a show cause notice on 7 September,

                          the Petitioner, the I&amp;B Ministry came to the conclusion that the colour and
                          layout of the bottle being the same as the whisky bottle of the advertiser, the
                          advertisement is nothing but surrogate advertising and hence, the direction
                          to issue an apology was imposed.
</p><p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_6">                          5.     This petition was listed before this Hon&#x27;ble Court on 15th February,
                          2021. After hearing the submissions made by the parties, considering the
                          video advertisement footage, as also the notice replied in the impugned
                          order, the Court had passed an order in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                      &quot;8.       The Cable Television Network Rules, 1994,
                                      stipulate under Rules 6 and 7 the `Programme Code&#x27;
                                      and `Advertising Code&#x27;. However, the consequences of
                                      violation thereof, are not clearly provided for. The
                                      matter thus requires consideration.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                                      9.        At this stage, the Court is only looking at
                                      what the interim relief, if any, ought to be granted
                                      considering that the apology has to be shown by the
                                      Petitioner from tonight from 0001 hours. Admittedly,
                                      there are no clear regulations as to the extent of
                                      penalty and punishment that can be imposed in case an
                                      advertisement is found to be objectionable and
                                      violative of the `Advertising Code&#x27;.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                                      10.       The counsel for the Petitioner has, during the
                                      video-conference hearing, exhibited the bottle used by
                                      the advertiser for Club Soda and Whisky. From a first
                                      look at the same, they appear very similar. The fact
                                      that the Whisky bottle and the Club Soda bottle used,
                                      have the same look and feel/trade dress, this Court is
                                      of the opinion that the entire order cannot be
                                      interdicted and stayed. The identity between the two
                                      product containers and the fact that the Petitioner uses
                                      an alternate bottle for its Club Soda, do raise questions
                                      relating to `Surrogate advertising&#x27;. However,

                                      disproportionate and keeping in mind that the apology
                                      so directed ought not to interfere unreasonably with
                                      the normal telecast of the channel, the frequency of the

<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_9">                          8.     Ld. CGSC further submits that as of June, 2021, the I&amp;B Ministry has
                          introduced       amendments     through    the   Cable    Television     Networks
                          (Amendment) Rules, 2021. As per the said amendments, a statutory
                          mechanism has been put in place for redressal of grievances and complaints
                          of citizens relating to content broadcast of television channels. The said

                          after recording various reasons that the apology ought to be given by the
                          Petitioner. However, due to the disproportionate nature of the extent of
                          apology the same was reduced. The apology, as directed by the Court is
                          already stated to have been run by the Petitioner.

                          Rules, the introduction of the amendments in 2021, would be relevant. As
                          per the amendments made to the Cable Television Networks (Amendment)
                          Rules, 2021 vide notification dated 17th June, 2021 three levels of complaint
