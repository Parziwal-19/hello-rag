                    order of this Court dated 07.10.2022. On the said date, the learned
                    counsel for the defendant no.1 had entered appearance and accepted
                    notice on behalf of the defendant no.1. Notice was, therefore, to be
                    served on the defendant nos.2 to 4.

<p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_2">                    2.       The Office Report indicates that the report of service on the
                    remaining defendants is awaited. The learned senior counsel for the
                    plaintiff, however, pleaded that in absence of an ex-parte ad-interim

                    created in the property in question, and, therefore, prays for grant of
                    an ad interim relief.

<p data-structure="Issue" id="p_3">                    3.       He has also drawn my attention to the Power of Attorney
                    executed by the defendant nos.2 to 4 in favour of the defendant no.1,
                    which, inter alia, authorizes the defendant no.1 to appear for them,
                    including sign a vakalatnama.

                    submits that the defendant no.1 possesses only 40% of share in the
                    subject-property. The Power of Attorney(ies) in favour of the
                    defendant no. 1 stand revoked by the defendant nos.2 to 4. He submits
                    that, therefore, the consideration of the present application and the
                    prayer of the plaintiff for the grant of an ad interim injunction must be
                    considered by this Court only when all the defendants are duly served.
</p>
<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_5">                    5.       I have considered the submissions made. I am of the opinion
                    that the plaintiff has been able to make out a case for grant of an ad-
                    interim ex-parte injunction so as to protect the status quo of the
                    property till the defendant nos. 2 to 4 enter appearance and are heard
                    in detail with respect to    their defence. In this regard, I am also
                    influenced by the fact that the entire dealing/correspondence with
                    respect to the transaction in question has been carried out with the
                    plaintiff by the defendant no. 1, who is duly represented. The order
                    passed today is only ad-interim in nature and can always be revisited
                    by this Court on hearing the remaining defendants as and when they
                    are duly served with the Suit and enter their appearance.

                    it is evident that the defendants obtained the possession of the said
                    property only on 09.07.2021. Reliance of the learned counsel for the
                    defendant no.1 on the e-mails prior thereto, therefore, in my prima
                    facie opinion would not come to the aid of the defendants.

<p data-structure="RespArg" id="p_26">                    23.      Be that as it may, by an e-mail dated 06.04.2020, the defendant
                    no.1 stated that the possession of the said property will be handed over
                    to the defendants on 31.05.2020. The plaintiff vide e-mail dated
                    25.05.2020 stated that it is ready and willing to perform the
                    agreement, however, due to outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and
                    restrictions imposed by the Government of India, the defendants must
                    give a firm time frame to the plaintiff as the plaintiff would be unable
                    to travel to India. The plaintiff further stated that Ms. Nivedita Kaul
                    had not handed over the possession of the subject-property to the
                    defendants. The email dated 25.05.2020 of the plaintiff is reproduced

                                      the corona virus outbreak in the country which
                                      is still in continuation being lockdown 04.

                                          As heard, the situation in USA is also not good
                                          and even flights are not coming to India,
                                          except for the stranded Indian citizens, though
                                          now proposed with certain conditions. I am
                                          surprised how you have fixed your travel with
                                          certainty though it is necessary for you to take
                                          over the possession from M. Nivedita Kaul.
                                          However, taking over possession can be done
                                          even if the curb remains operative as you need
                                          not go to an public place such as Sub

                                          Therefore, in view of the aforesaid facts and
                                          circumstances, it is pre-mature to commit

                                          possible date and time, once threat of corona

                                          India in July, 2020. I understand that your visit
                                          in this situation is not safe but on the same
                                          time I also know that without your
                                          presence/visit here in Delhi (India), getting the
                                          possession of the property can be more
                                          delayed, as we have already wasted almost 22
                                          months on this. I still remember when we
                                          entered in to the transaction in November&#x27;
                                          2018, as communicated, we were quite
                                          confident of getting the possession within 6
                                          months. Keeping in mind the said scenario, I
                                          kept myself fully prepared by all means. I
                                          could not use the funds nor I could derive any
                                          benefit therefrom. Now almost 22 months have
                                          been passed and the position is still the same.
                                          Even the real estate market is not the same as
                                          it was in 2018-19 and the prices have fallen
                                          down by 20% to 25% specially in this
                                          pandemic situation. Thus, it is requested to
                                          kindly let me know your schedule to visit here
                                          in Delhi (India) so that you can take over the

                    its readiness and willingness to perform its obligations under the
                    Agreement. The plaintiff pleaded for a permission to visit the subject
                    property along with the bank officials for the purpose of obtaining the
                    bank loan. The parties thereafter exchanged a few more e-mails.
</p>
<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_31">                    28.      It is by an e-mail dated 13.09.2021 that the defendant no.1
                    pleaded that as almost three years had expired from the execution of
                    the agreement, the defendants would like to re-negotiate the terms
                    thereof. The defendants also offered to return the advance received by
                    their father to the plaintiff. The plaintiff, by an e-mail dated
                    17.09.2021, however, insisted upon the defendants to comply with the
                    terms of the Agreement, and also asserted that it is arranging the
                    balance sale consideration to conclude the sales transaction of the said
                    property on 03.10.2021, that is, on completion of the sixty days&#x27;
                    notice period. The defendants, however, insisted on a re-negotiation of
                    the price, and on the same, again various e-mails were exchanged
                    between the parties.
</p>
<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_32">                    29.      As the parties could not arrive at a settlement of their disputes,
                    they also initiated a pre-suit mediation, which also resulted in a failure
                    on 02.06.2022. The plaintiff has thereafter filed the present suit on
                    22.09.2022.

</p><p data-structure="RespArg" id="p_34">                    30.      From the above exchange of e-mails, prima facie it appears that
                    the plaintiff has always been ready and willing to perform its part of
                    the Agreement. The Agreement could not be performed earlier as the
                    defendants had not been able to obtain physical possession of the
                    subject property from the wife and the daughter of the defendant no.1.
                    On obtaining such possession, the defendant no.1 sought compliance
                    with the terms of the agreement from the plaintiff, which the plaintiff
                    duly consented to. The plaintiff has also placed on record a copy of the
                    correspondence dated 01.11.2021 from HDFC Ltd. communicating its
                    principle approval of a loan of Rs. 7 Crores in favour of the plaintiff.
                    Prima facie, therefore, I find no merit in the submission of the learned
                    counsel for the defendant no. 1 that the plaintiff has failed to show its
                    readiness and willingness to perform the Agreement. The judgments
                    cited, therefore, do not appear to be of any help to the case of the
                    defendant no. 1.

                    raised for the first time by the defendant no.1 vide e-mail dated
                    06.04.2020. As noted hereinabove, thereafter also the defendant no.1
                    did not state the said ground for re-negotiating the deal with the
                    plaintiff, till 13.08.2021. In fact, by the email dated 04.08.2021, the
                    defendant no. 1 called upon the plaintiff to complete the sale
                    transaction. The same, therefore, appears to be an afterthought. The
                    learned senior counsel for the plaintiff has also asserted that it was at
                    the request of the father of the defendant no. 1 that the TDS was not
                    deposited by it. In any case, the plaintiff is being put to conditions in

<p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_36">                    32.      On the issue of the plaintiff having deposited only 6.2% of the
                    sale consideration, in my opinion, this was the bargain arrived at
                    between the father of the defendant no.1, through the defendant no.1
                    himself. The defendant no.1 cannot now plead that only because the
                    plaintiff was made to deposit 6.2% of the total Sale Consideration, the
                    plaintiff must be denied the relief of Specific Performance. The parties
                    are free to enter into their bargain and it&#x27;s not for this Court to judge
                    the reasonableness of these terms. In any case, these are matters which
                    have to be considered once the defendants file their response to the
                    suit. <span class="citetext" data-sentiment="Pos" data-docid="64833870" id="span_85">In this regard, I may also take note of the judgment of the

                    wherein, the Supreme Court has observed that the adequacy of
                    monetary damages as a ground for rejection of relief of Specific
                    Performance/injunction has been done away with by the legislature in

<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_38">                    34.      At this stage, I do not deem it proper to deal in detail with the
                    other judgments which are cited by the learned counsel for the
                    defendantno.1 as the defendants are yet to file their response to the
                    application as also to the suit. At present, the subject matter of the
                    present suit deserves to be preserved. Suffice it to say, the plaintiff for
                    the above recorded reasons has been able to make out a good prima
                    facie case in its favour. The balance of convenience is also in favour
                    of the plaintiff and against the defendants. The plaintiff is likely to
                    suffer a grave irreparable injury in case the ad-interim injunction is
                    not granted in its favour, for the reason that the plaintiff has waited for
                    three years for the Specific Performance of the Agreement and cannot
                    now be left at the mercy of the defendants.

<p data-structure="Conclusion" id="p_39">                    35.      In view of the above, until further orders, the defendants are
                    restrained from creating any third-party interest or parting with
                    possession of the said property till further orders. This shall, however,
                    be subject to the condition that the plaintiff deposits the amount of the
                    TDS as stipulated in the Agreement, along with the applicable interest
                    and penalty, in the account of the father of the defendants, with the
                    Income Tax Department within a period of four weeks from today and
                    furnish proof thereof on an affidavit before this Court. The plaintiff
                    shall further deposit a sum of Rs.5 Crores with the Registrar General
