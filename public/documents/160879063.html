                          counsel for the Petitioner submits that the Petitioner/tenant is entitled to
                          summon the official witnesses for the purposes of proving its case before the
                          slum authority.

                          observe that the tenant has completely abused the court process. The
                          witnesses which the tenant wishes to summon relate to the Alhmeds and
                          Court Staff from the Courts where his own cases against his employers and
                          other cases are pending. Those are judicial records for which the certified
                          copies could have been easily obtained by the tenant.

                          Respondent/landlady are delayed indefinitely. The original application was
                          filed in April, 2019. The orders rejecting the applications were passed by
                          the competent authority and, thereafter even the appeal that was preferred
                          has been decided by the impugned order issued by the Financial
                          Commissioner. The tenant has been unsuccessful before all the authorities

                          slum authorities, this Court is convinced that that the tenant has wasted very
                          precious quasi-judicial time of the competent authorities and of this Court.
                          These being proceedings filed in which the Petitioner himself was the party,
                          no question arises of summoning the said Alhmeds and the Court staff for
                          proving these records. Considering the large number of cases listed before
                          these Courts, the Alhmeds, record in-charge of the Tis Hazari Court cannot
                          be entangled in the proceedings between the tenant and the landlady in this
