</p><p data-structure="Facts" id="p_3">                             3. The respondent no.2, on 23.02.2019, published an advertisement for
                                recruitment to the post of Assistant Grade III in the General, Depot,

                                being eligible, applied for appointment to the aforementioned posts
                                and consequently appeared in the Phase-I examination held on
                                02.06.2019, which examination comprised of 100 Multiple Choice

</p><p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_4">                             4. Upon being declared successful in the Phase-I examinations on
                                08.07.2019, the petitioners then appeared in the Phase-II examinations
                                on 27.07.2019, which comprised of 120 multiple choice questions to
                                be solved in 90 minutes, results whereof were declared in December,
                                2019. The petitioners, however, did not find their names in the
                                category of selected candidates and therefore made various
                                representations, including filing of applications under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_2">Right to

                                Phase-II examination.      It was only in December, 2020 that the
                                petitioners were, without reasons being assigned informed that their
                                candidature had been withheld.

                                petitioners, in February, 2021, approached the respondents to inquire
                                about the reasons for their candidature being withheld. It is then that
                                the respondent no.2 provided them with a copy of the impugned list
                                which stated that the results of some candidates including the
                                petitioners had been withheld in accordance with the recruitment
                                notification. The petitioners were also verbally informed that this was
                                due to a similarity in the pattern of their answers with the answers of
                                some other candidates in the Phase-II examination. The respondents,
                                however, refused to provide details of the same to the petitioners,
                                leading to the filing of the present petitions.

                                the respondents perceive, could only have been arrived at by doing

                                was a mere co-incidence as the examination, in which the petitioners
                                appeared, was a computer based examination, wherein a large number
                                of students appear across the country. Once the respondent no.2 has
                                itself taken a stand in its counter affidavit that all the options of a
                                particular question were made attractive enough, a similarity of
                                pattern in answering some of the questions with similar wrong/blank
                                answers by the petitioners, cannot be taken to be so improbable so as
                                to infer that they had indulged in malpractice. It is not unusual for
                                candidates who may not know the correct answers to choose the next
                                probable answer. He, therefore, contends that a mere similarity in the
                                pattern of answers of the petitioners and some other candidates in a
                                multiple choice question examination like the one in the present case,
                                could not be the sole basis for holding the petitioners guilty of

                                whose answers were allegedly similar, were not seated in the same

                                examination centre did not submit any adverse report regarding their
                                conduct, the petitioners, could not have said to be indulging in any use

                                questions, answers whereof could only have been arrived at after
                                doing rough work, it was evident that they had indulged in unfair
                                means, is, also without any basis. He submits that the respondent no.2
                                has failed to consider that when candidates with different intellectual
                                levels having strength in different subjects appear in a competitive
                                exam, there is every probability that a candidate might not require
                                rough work for answering some of the questions. Moreover, once the
                                respondent no.2 had only provided a short window of 90 minutes to
                                attempt 120 questions in the examination, a candidate, in an attempt
                                to answer all the questions, may not deem it necessary to do detailed
                                calculations to mark the answer, which he perceives to be correct. He,
                                therefore, submits that merely because a candidate did not do rough

</p><p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_12">                             11.Mr. Gupta finally submits that the reliance of the respondent no.2 on
                                clause 38 of the advertisement to contend that a candidate did not
                                have any vested right in the selection process does not imply that the
                                respondents had a right to hold the petitioners as guilty of having
                                indulged in unfair means without giving them an opportunity to show
                                that they had not resorted to unfair means or even following the basic
                                principles of natural justice. As per clause 38 of the advertisement,
                                while the respondent no.2 was entitled to analyze the answers of
                                candidates, the same could not imply that the result of candidates
                                would simply be withheld on the basis of an analysis without even
                                putting them to any notice. A mere similarity in the pattern of answers
                                to some questions out of the large number of questions which a
                                candidate was required to solve in limited time available, could not be
                                the sole ground to withhold the result of every candidate, some of
                                whose answers were matching with other candidates. He, therefore,
                                contends that if this criteria of similarity in pattern of answers to about
                                25% of the questions i.e., 30 out of 120 as alleged by the respondents
                                was to be adopted for cancelling the candidature of candidates without
                                giving them an opportunity to explain their stand, the same would
                                lead to absurd conclusions and could seriously prejudice candidates
                                who bonafidely attempted the questions. He, therefore, prays that the
                                writ petitions be allowed and the respondents be forthwith directed to
                                appoint the petitioners, who have been suffering for the last many

                                procedure set out in the advertisement. He submits that in accordance

                                had engaged the services of Institute of Banking Personnel Selection
                                (IBPS), which is one of the most experienced and reputed
                                organizations for conducting recruitments in various public sector
                                undertakings. The said organization follows a scientific/theoretical
                                model, in line with the international standards for detecting the use of
                                unfair means, if any, resorted to by the candidates during examination
                                and thereafter sends a report/analytical data of pairs of candidates
                                suspected to have resorted to unfair means. Moreover, the analysis
                                report of the IBPS, was thereafter examined by a panel of experts of

                                evidence of any random marking, identical matches of intermittent

                                conclusion arrived at by the respondent no.2 that the petitioners had
                                adopted unfair means, cannot be, in any manner said to be arbitrary or
                                illegal.

                                after doing some rough work. This he submits, as per the IBPS, was
                                not possible and therefore, even this indicates that the petitioners had
                                resorted to copying. Infact, a detailed analysis had also been carried
                                out of the time spent by the petitioners on different sections of the
                                question paper whereupon it was found that even when they had
                                correctly answered all the questions in certain sections, there was no
                                activity on the computer screen for quite some time during the exam.
                                All these factors taken together were clearly indicative of        their
                                having indulged in unfair means

                                having indulged in unfair means is further substantiated by the fact
                                that they chose examination centers other than those at their place of
                                residence. The petitioners in the present case were all residents of
                                Haryana but for inexplicable reasons, opted for centers in Shimla and
                                had accordingly been allotted centers in Shimla or Solan. There was
                                no reason as to why candidates from Haryana would opt for
                                Shimla/Solan unless they were assured that they would be facilitated
                                in using unfair means in these centers. Moreover, both these centers
                                have been blacklisted after candidates therein were found to have
                                indulged in unfair means. Even this, he contends clearly indicates that
                                the petitioners had indulged in malpractice.

                                The second issue would be primarily factual as to whether the

                                opportunity to show cause against the allegations of unfair means, is

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                   24. The Court is conscious that technology often empowers
                                   citizens; at the same time it has the potential to facilitate
                                   misuse. In the context of the facts of this case, this Court is not
                                   persuaded with the appellant&#x27;s submission that without tangible
                                   material or evidence, the SBI could not have inferred the
                                   employment of &quot;unfair means&quot; by candidates generally and the
                                   petitioner In particular. Use of electronic devices to transmit
                                   information either in the form of text messages or by use of
                                   hidden listening devices which go undetected may be hard to
                                   establish. That does not mean that patterns which are
                                   discernible and are thrown up on application of scientific
                                   formulae or statistical models, which leads to further
                                   examination of the primary material should be eliminated by
                                   the Courts. In the present case, the pattern which emerged
                                   showed that the appellant&#x27;s results in respect of wrong answers.

                                   New Delhi centre. On further scrutiny, the reasonableness of
                                   the suspicion was strengthened by the manner of his attempting
                                   the answers. These, in the opinion of the Court, were sufficient
                                   basis for the SBI to conclude that unfair means had been
                                   employed and withhold his result. The directions sought are,
                                   therefore, unavailable in exercise of judicial review discretion
                                   under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. As a result, this Court
                                   finds that the impugned judgment and order of the learned
                                   Single Judge does not call for interference. The appeal is,
                                   therefore, dismissed without any order as to costs.

                                has the potential to facilitate misuse, the use of hidden electronic
                                devices to transmit information, cannot be simply ignored as is
                                wished by the petitioners.       Even otherwise, the Courts are not
                                expected to sit over the judgment of an expert body regarding the
                                methodology or the procedure adopted by them to determine the use
                                of unfair means in an examination. I am, therefore, inclined to agree
                                with the respondent no.2 that the use of the statistical methods
                                adopted by the IBPS to analyse the performance of the candidates,
                                cannot be said to be impermissible. This Court is therefore, unable to
                                hold that the analysis by the use of scientific methodology/ statistical
                                methods by an expert body like the IBPS, cannot be taken into
                                account to determine the question of use of unfair means in an
                                examination. However, this does not imply that the respondent no.2,
                                merely on the basis of an analysis carried out by experts, can
                                straightaway paint the candidates as having indulged in use of unfair
                                means. I may therefore, now proceed to examine whether the decision
                                of the respondent no.2 to withhold the candidature of the petitioners in
                                the present case, was valid.</span>

                                in the present case, the respondent no.2 could have cancelled the
                                candidature of the petitioners as had been done, without informing

                                which they were subsequently informed, was on the basis of a
                                similarity of pattern in their answers to some questions, which
                                similarity is stated to have been identified by the IBPS. Learned
                                counsel for the respondent no.2 has however, urged that once the
                                advertisement itself made it clear that the candidature of a candidate
                                may be cancelled if upon analysis of his answers, he is found to have
                                indulged in use of unfair means and thus, there was no requirement to
                                issue any notice to the petitioners. It has also been urged that action
                                against the petitioner has been taken strictly in accordance with the
                                terms of the advertisement and the respondent no.2 was fully justified
                                in rejecting the candidature of those candidates who were suspected to
                                have indulged in malpractice. In any event, in the counter affidavit
                                filed before this Court, the reasons for arriving at the conclusion that
                                the petitioners had indulged in unfair means, have been clearly spelt
                                out and therefore, there has been no violation of principles of natural
                                justice.

                                filing of the counter affidavit that the respondent no.2 for the first
                                time, furnished some details of the analysis of the petitioners&#x27; answers
                                as carried out by the IBPS, which according to them, conclusively
                                showed that the petitioners had used unfair means.
</p><p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_26">                             24.Before this Court, once it transpired that the respondent no.2 had not
                                even informed the petitioners about the basis for holding them guilty
                                of indulging in unfair means, the respondent no.2, through the
                                additional documents, made an effort to demonstrate before this Court
                                by producing a comparative tabulation of answers of the petitioners
                                along with the details of their examination centres to contend that the
                                cancellation of the petitioners&#x27; candidature was justified.        Even
                                though, this attempt of the respondent no.2, on the first blush, appears
                                to prima facie substantiate its stand, on a closer scrutiny of the
                                analysis presented before this Court, I am of the view that it is not for
                                this Court to either analyse the matching answers to some of the
                                questions or give its opinion as to whether some of the questions,
                                which the respondent no.2 urge, were complex and could not have
                                been solved without rough work, were indeed so complex that the
                                petitioners, despite being aware that they had limited time of 90
                                minutes to solve 120 questions, could not have been attempted to
                                answer without doing any rough work. The Court is not an expert on
                                these aspects and therefore, despite the respondent no.2&#x27;s attempt to
                                demonstrate the rationale of the methodology used by it, it would not
                                be appropriate for this Court to venture into this exercise. It is only

                                doubts and suspicion of the respondent no.2 on the analysis report.
</p><p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_27">                             25.In my considered view, even though it cannot be said that the use of
                                statistical methods by the IBPS to analyse the answers was per se
                                impermissible, it was still incumbent upon the respondent no.2 to put
                                the petitioners to notice and accord an opportunity to them to reply to
                                the allegations levelled against them by providing them with copies of
                                the material based on which it could have been held that they had
                                used unfair means in the examination. It is only after following a fair
                                procedure that action against the petitioners, if found guilty, could
                                have been initiated. The respondent no.2 has, however, given a
                                complete go-by to the principles of natural justice and merely
                                proceeded to withhold the petitioners&#x27; candidature on the basis of a
                                mere speculation that they had indulged in unfair means. This
                                speculation is stated to be on account of a similarity in the pattern of
                                their wrong and blank answers with those of some other candidates.
                                However, even though the use of this analysis by the respondent no.2
                                may be permissible, the fact remains that the conclusion arrived at by
                                the respondent no.2 is still based on a speculation and the conclusion
                                against the petitioners has been drawn without even knowing their
                                stand. Had the petitioners not approached this Court by way of the
                                present petitions, they would not have to been able to decipher as to
                                why their candidature had been withheld. I, am therefore, of the view
                                that the petitioners are justified in complaining about principles of
                                natural justice, having been violated and they having been held to be
                                guilty of indulging in unfair means, without any opportunity of show
                                cause being granted to them.

                                opinion of this Court, the respondent no.2 ought to have followed,
                                isthat the person against whom any penal action is taken must be put
                                to adequate notice of the matter in hand and give him an opportunity
                                to put up his best defence. It needs no reiteration that the principles of
                                natural justice are to be fully complied with and are not a mere empty
                                formality unless the facts show that no useful purpose would be
                                served by granting an opportunity to the delinquent. From the material
                                placed on record by the respondent no.2, I am unable to persuade
                                myself to accept their plea that in the present case, the culpability of
                                the petitioners was evident and therefore, there was no requirement to
                                follow principles of natural justice before cancelling their candidature.

                                  Notice should be clear and precise so as to give the other party

                                civilized jurisprudence that a person against whom any action is
                                sought to be taken or whose right or interests are being affected
                                should be given a reasonable opportunity to defend himself. The basic
                                principle of natural justice is that before adjudication starts, the
                                authority concerned should give to the affected party a notice of the
                                case against him so that he can defend himself. Such notice should be
                                adequate and the grounds necessitating action and the penalty/action
                                proposed should be mentioned specifically and unambiguously. An
                                order travelling beyond the bounds of notice is impermissible and
                                without jurisdiction to that extent. This Court in <a href="/doc/1186413/" id="a_24">Nasir Ahmad v.

                                grounds on the basis of which an action is proposed to be taken so as
                                to enable the noticee to answer the case against him. If these
                                conditions are not satisfied, the person cannot be said to have been

                                means. In the present case, the respondent no.2 has held the
                                petitioners guilty of indulging in unfair means on the basis of a mere
                                similarity in the pattern of their wrong and blank answers with some
                                other candidates without giving them any opportunity to even show
                                that this similarity in respect of answers to a few questions was too
                                inconsequential. The petitioners were not given any show cause notice
                                against the charges levelled against them before issuance of the
                                impugned list. The petitioners have vehemently contended that many
                                of them were seated in different examination centres and had no
                                physical contact with each other. They have also urged and in my
                                view, rightly so that merely because that they had attempted a large
                                number of questions in a very short span of time or that they were
                                sitting idle for some time during the examination, could not alone, be
                                a ground to hold that they had indulged in unfair means. Moreover,
                                the log sheets in support of this plea were neither filed before this
                                Court by the respondent no.2 nor were put to the petitioners. In the
                                present case, the examination was a competitive exam where
                                candidates with different levels of intellect appear who have their
                                strengths in different areas/sections/subjects. It is always possible that
                                a candidate might not require rough work for answering a particular
                                question and may based on his/her acumen, answer the question
                                directly. I also cannot lose sight of the fact that the candidates
                                appearing in the examination were only allotted 90 minutes to attempt
                                120 questions in the objective type test. A candidate, who attempts a
                                competitive examination sits in the same with an aim to answer most

                                of the questions correctly so as to get selected. In an exam where a
                                candidate has only been allotted 90 minutes to answer the entire
                                paper, it is likely that in an attempt to answer most of the questions, a
                                candidate might not deem it necessary to do rough work for arriving
                                at an answer to a particular question considering the paucity of time.
                                It also needs to be noted that though the advertisement issued by the
                                respondents stipulated that the answers of the candidates would be
                                analyzed and compared to detect patterns of similarity, the same did
                                not either stipulate that rough work would be mandatory for
                                answering questions or that the respondent no.2 would analyze the
                                rough sheets of the candidates.

                                petitioners were matching, it is the few identical matches of
                                wrong/blank answers, which has been made the basis for the
                                respondent no.2&#x27;s conclusion that they had resorted to unfair means. It
                                is the respondent no.2&#x27;sown stand that all the choices of answers were
                                made attractive enough and therefore, even the aspect of the
                                petitioners&#x27; few wrong answers matching had to be considered, by
                                taking into account this factor. The speculation of similarity in
                                answers, even if arrived at by IBPS by applying any scientific model,
                                could not have been the sole basis of holding the petitioners guilty
                                without giving them an opportunity even to explain their stand. In my

</p><p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_37">                                    12. We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner, perused
                                    the impugned order and the relevant record and considered the
                                    submissions. The first show-cause notice was quashed by the
                                    Tribunal, firstly on the ground that it lacked in material
                                    particulars inasmuch, as, it did not contain any details of the
                                    alleged malpractice/ copying and the modus operandi allegedly
                                    adopted by the applicant in coming to the conclusion that the
                                    applicant had resorted to any malpractices copying in the Tier-
                                    II examination. It is, precisely, for this reason that the Tribunal
                                    required the furnishing of details, as aforesaid in paragraphs
                                    20 to 24 of its order dated 22.11.2013. The rationale behind the
                                    petitioner SSC being required to furnish the details was simply
                                    that the applicant and other candidates could not be condemned
                                    on the basis of vague and non-specific allegation of a serious
                                    nature, which impinge on their candidature and future
                                    prospects. If according to the petitioner, malpractice cheating
                                    find been resorted to by the applicant &amp; the other candidates, it
                                    was essential that such candidates were, at least, informed of
                                    the basis on which it had been concluded, or a prima-facie view
                                    formed, that such malpractices/ etc of cheating had been
                                    undertaken. The petitioner should have given the reasons for its
                                    said conclusions, by disclosing as to what was the analysis
                                    undertaken by the experts/ outside agency; what was the pattern
                                    discerned by the outside experts upon analysis of the answer-
                                    sheets of all such candidates, and; that the disclosed pattern
                                    could lead to a reasonable inference with a very high
                                    probability near certainty of cheating/ malpractice. Without
                                    such disclosure, the applicant and other candidates were left in
                                    the dark, not knowing how to meet the serious allegations made
                                    against them, except by simply denying the same- which they
                                    did.

                                    impression that the petitioner merely window-dressed the
                                    earlier show-cause notice, and served the same upon the
                                    applicant again. In fact, there was hardly any difference in the
