                          estranged and used to consume liquor with the accused, therefore, at

                          a tea stall and used to leave for work at 8 A.M. and return back at 8:00-
                          8.30 PM. On 29.12.2015, the school of the child victim was closed and
                          her mother left the house in the morning instructing her to go to her
                          Nani‟s house with her younger son. The house of her Nani was close

                          however, she could not find him. On the next day, during night hours,
                          the child victim saw the accused outside the house and told her mother
                          after identifying him. The mother of the child victim apprehended him

                          the child victim PW-1, deposed that in the absence of her mother and
                          siblings, the accused, who was residing near her house, used to come to
                          her house and after bolting door from inside, used to insert his finger in
                          her urinating part.    She further deposed that the accused used to
                          threaten her by saying that her mother is not residing with her and he
                          would kill her mother if she disclosed the incident to anyone. The child

                          but she could not succeed as the child victim had only disclosed her

                          stated to be near the house of the child victim and there were many
                          other tenants residing adjoining their house. Since all the occupiers of

                          difficult for her to recognize the accused. She explains that since she
                          was not aware firstly, with respect to the incident; and secondly, with
                          respect to the culprit, therefore, she could not lodge the complaint with
                          the police and it is only when the child victim pointed out that the
                          appellant is the accused who committed the crime, she caught hold of
                          the appellant and made the call to the police.            Accordingly after
                          registration of the FIR, the investigation was carried out.

                          commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below 12 years is liable
                          for punishment under <a href="/doc/183539218/" id="a_34">Section 6</a> of the POCSO Act, which prescribes
                          punishment for aggravated penetrative assault. The age of the child
                          victim has been proved by producing admissible evidence. The next
                          question that arises for immediate consideration is whether the
                          evidence and material prove the case of the prosecution beyond
                          reasonable doubt.

                          that an accused is presumed to be innocent, till he is proved to be
                          guilty. It is equally well settled that suspicion, however, strong can
                          never take the place of proof. There is indeed a long distance between
                          accused &quot;may have committed the offence and must have committed the
                          offence&quot; which must be traversed by the prosecution by adducing
                          reliable and cogent evidence. Presumption of innocence has been
                          recognised as a human right which cannot be whittled down. (See:</p>

                          reasons for seeking corroboration. The evidence of the prosecutrix is
                          more reliable than that of any other witness. The court should find no
                          difficulty in acting on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone
                          to convict an accused, where her testimony inspires confidence and is
                          found to be reliable. Minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies
                          in the statement of the prosecutrix should not be a ground for throwing

                          trustworthy, the conviction cannot be upheld. In paragraph No. 8 of <a href="/doc/67876640/" id="a_46">the

                          evidence did not inspire confidence, was contradictory, unnatural and

                          &quot;In our considered opinion, the „sterling witness‟ should
                          be of a very high quality and caliber whose version
                          should, therefore, be unassailable. The Court considering
                          the version of such witness should be in a position to
                          accept it for its face value without any hesitation. To test
                          the quality of such a witness, the status of the witness
                          would be immaterial and what would be relevant is the
                          truthfulness of the statement made by such a witness. What
                          would be more relevant would be the consistency of the
                          statement right from the starting point till the end, namely,
                          at the time when the witness makes the initial statement
                          and ultimately before the Court. It should be natural and
                          consistent with the case of the prosecution qua the
                          accused. There should not be any prevarication in the
                          version of such a witness. The witness should be in a
                          position to withstand the cross- examination of any length
                          and howsoever strenuous it may be and under no
                          circumstance should give room for any doubt as to the
                          factum of the occurrence, the persons involved, as well as,
                          the sequence of it. Such a version should have co-relation
                          with each and everyone of other supporting material such
                          as the recoveries made, the weapons used, the manner of
                          offence committed, the scientific evidence and the expert
                          opinion. The said version should consistently match with
                          the version of every other witness. It can even be stated
                          that it should be akin to the test applied in the case of
                          circumstantial evidence where there should not be any
                          missing link in the chain of circumstances to hold the
                          accused guilty of the offence alleged against him. Only if
                          the version of such a witness qualifies the above test as
                          well as all other similar such tests to be applied, it can be
                          held that such a witness can be called as a „sterling
                          witness‟ whose version can be accepted by the Court
                          without any corroboration and based on which the guilty
                          can be punished. To be more precise, the version of the
                          said witness on the core spectrum of the crime should
                          remain intact while all other attendant materials, namely,
                          oral, documentary and material objects should match the

                          testimony of the prosecutrix has to be observed. In the instant case, the
                          date of alleged incident is 29.12.2015 and the matter was reported on
                          01.01.2016. The only delay explained by the mother of the prosecutrix
                          is that she did not know the identity of the accused on 29.12.2015. PW-
                          2/mother of the victim admits that on the date of incident i.e. on
                          29.12.2015 itself the victim had told her about the incident. She
                          explained that after 2-3 days when the victim saw the accused, she
                          called her mother and pointed out towards the accused that he is the
                          same person who committed wrong act with her. On pointing out by
                          the victim, PW-2/mother of the victim, went to the room of the accused
                          and apprehended him and she came to know the name of the accused as
                          Dil Bahadur. She therefore, reported the matter to police on 100
                          number. Ex.PW8/A is the intimation recorded by the police in Form 8
                          of the Delhi Police Control Room. The nature of allegation recorded
                          therein is &#x27;eve teasing&#x27;. The entry of intimation of call at 100 number is
                          dated 31.12.2015 at 08:47 PM. Name of the appellant is mentioned
                          therein that the appellant „Dil Bahadur&#x27; had committed the offence. The
                          MLC is Ex.PW6/A dated 31.12.2105 at 10:49 PM.

<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_25">                          22.   In the column of history of the case, in MLC it is mentioned that
                          the victim and the mother of the victim did not know the name of the
                          accused. MLC shows the possibility of hymen being torn. It is recorded
                          &quot;Hymen seems to be torn&quot;. PW-1/ child victim in her statement says
                          that the accused was residing near her house and used to come to her
                          house and after bolting the door from inside, used to insert his finger in
                          her urinating part. PW-2, mother of victim also admits in her evidence
                          that the victim on 29.12.2015, itself told her that her neighbour did
                          wrong act with her. What is to be noticed is that firstly, on 29.12.2015,

                          nothing prevented PW-2/mother of the victim to make a call at 100
                          number and report the matter. This also becomes important for the
                          reason that the accused was residing in the same building and was a
                          neighbour. Secondly, when PW-2 had come to know that their
                          neighbour did wrong act with her daughter, it was not expected from
                          her to remain quiet till she could find out the culprit. She did not state
                          anything with respect to efforts or endeavours made by her to find out
                          the culprit that too when PW-1 clearly stated that the culprit was her
                          neighbour. Thirdly, when she made the call at 100 number, name of the
                          accused was mentioned to the police but surprisingly name of the
                          culprit was not mentioned when she went to the hospital for MLC.

                          incident of sexual assault. In her statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_56">Section 161</a> of the
                          Cr.P.C., child victim also speaks about a single incident of assault on
                          29.12.2015. In statement under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_57">Section 164</a> of the Cr.P.C, the child
                          victim says that the accused was regularly committing sexual assault.
                          PW-5 in her statement states that when she asked the child victim about
                          the incident, she told her that the accused did not commit any wrong
                          with her. PW-5 is the prosecution witness, who has not been declared
                          hostile. The evidence of the prosecution witness can be relied upon by
                          the accused if the witness has not been declared hostile (See:- <a href="/doc/170309994/" id="a_58">Raja

                          there are material inconsistencies relating to the happening of the
                          offence, there are statement that range between a single assault,
                          repeated assault and no assault taking place. It is to be noted that in the
                          police Form the incident recorded was only of „eve-teasing‟ (EX-
                          PW8/A). Thus, the original complaint started with „eve-teasing‟ which
                          went upto &#x27;single assault&#x27; and finally reached upto &quot;repeated assault&quot;.</span></span>

</p><p data-structure="Conclusion" id="p_28">                          24.   This court is conscious of the fact that even single incident alone
                          is sufficient for convicting the accused, however, the court is
                          considering the entire evidence so as to analyze the credibility of the
                          prosecution case. PW 4 &amp; PW 5, landlord and landlady, also stated that
                          the victim&#x27;s mother is quarrelsome and did not pay rent on time. They
                          further stated that the victim&#x27;s mother used to quarrel with her husband
                          with respect to liquor consumption. PW-2/mother of the victim
                          however admits that her husband used to consume liquor with accused.

<p data-structure="Conclusion" id="p_29">                          25.    In view of the aforesaid, analysis of evidence, this court finds
                          that the evidence of the child victim is not of sterling nature. The same
                          does not inspire confidence of this court to prove the case beyond
                          reasonable doubt. There is no positive medical evidence and the
                          evidence of the mother of the child victim also suffers with material
                          contradictions and does not inspire confidence.

<p data-structure="Conclusion" id="p_30">                          26.   In view of the aforesaid, this court sets aside the judgment of
                          conviction and order on sentence passed by the trial court. The
                          appellant is acquitted. He be released forthwith if not required in any
